This was the first meeting of Project 4 so there were no tasks assigned to be completed yet.

Discussed: What features we wanted implemented in project 4 (and if there were any changes from what we had previously planned).


For next meeting:
- Divide up tasks
- Begin thinking about what social media integration we want (which social media sites)
- Figure out how we will refactor Javascript to have classes
- Update product backlog for new features.
- Start on design for how code will be refactored
