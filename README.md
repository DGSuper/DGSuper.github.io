How to play:
3x3 Board:
- This is a simple 3x3 Tic Tac Toe game with all the basic rules.

9x9 Board:
- To win, one must win three 3x3 sub-boards. 
- Where your opponent will play the next move depends on the placement of your current move. For example, if you place an X/O in the top right corner of any box, the next move will have to be in the top right 3x3 box. To win a 3x3 box is the same as winning a simple 3x3 game.
- Every move alternates between X's and O's.
